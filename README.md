# Arbitrage Bot for Cryptocurrency
Python automated script to identify any potential arbitrage opportunities between two exchanges (RIP FTX)

# Description

This code example connects to the Binance and FTX exchanges using the API keys, retrieves the latest prices and order book data for the assets of interest, and identifies any potential arbitrage opportunities between the two exchanges. It then calculates the profit potential of each opportunity, and if it is above a certain threshold, it automatically places the appropriate buy and sell orders on the two exchanges. This is a very basic example, and in practice, you would need to add additional code for error handling, logging, and other functionality to make the bot more robust and reliable.
